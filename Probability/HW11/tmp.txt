5.88 Suppose that you are told to toss a die until you have observed each of the six faces. What is
the expected number of tosses required to complete your assignment? [Hint: If Y is the number
of trials to complete the assignment, Y = Y1 + Y2 + Y3 + Y4 + Y5 + Y6 , where Y1 is the trial on
which the first face is tossed, Y1 = 1, Y2 is the number of additional tosses required to get a face
different than the first, Y3 is the number of additional tosses required to get a face different than
the first two distinct faces, . . . , Y6 is the number of additional tosses to get the last remaining
face after all other faces have been observed. Notice further that for i = 1, 2, . . . , 6, Yi has a
geometric distribution with success probability (7 − i)/6.]

5.89 In Exercise 5.1, we determined that the joint distribution of Y1 , the number of contracts awarded
to firm A, and Y2 , the number of contracts awarded to firm B, is given by the entries in the
following table.
y1
y2 0 1 2
0 1/9 2/9 1/9
1 2/9 2/9 0
2 1/9 0 0
Find Cov(Y1, Y2). Does it surprise you that Cov(Y1, Y2) is negative? Why?
5.90 In Exercise 5.3, we determined that the joint probability distribution of Y1 , the number of
married executives, and Y2 , the number of never-married executives, is given by
p(y1, y2) =
( 4
y1
) ( 3
y2
) ( 2
3 − y1 − y2
)
( 9

) ,
where y1 and y2 are integers, 0 ≤ y1 ≤ 3, 0 ≤ y2 ≤ 3, and 1 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 3. Find Cov(Y1, Y2).
5.91 In Exercise 5.8, we derived the fact that
f (y1, y2) =
{ 4y1 y2, 0 ≤ y1 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y2 ≤ 1,
0, elsewhere.
Show that Cov(Y1, Y2) = 0. Does it surprise you that Cov(Y1, Y2) is zero? Why?

5.92 In Exercise 5.9, we determined that
f (y1, y2) =
{ 6(1 − y2), 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 1,

is a valid joint probability density function. Find Cov(Y1, Y2). Are Y1 and Y2 independent?
5.93 Let the discrete random variables Y1 and Y2 have the joint probability function
p(y1, y2) = 1/3, for (y1, y2) = (−1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0).
Find Cov(Y1, Y2). Notice that Y1 and Y2 are dependent. (Why?) This is another example of
uncorrelated random variables that are not independent.
5.94 Let Y1 and Y2 be uncorrelated random variables and consider U1 = Y1 + Y2 and U2 = Y1 − Y2 .

a Find Cov(Y1, Y2).
b Are Y1 and Y2 independent? (See Exercise 5.55.)
c Find the coefficient of correlation for Y1 and Y2 .
d Does your answer to part (b) lead you to doubt your answer to part (a)? Why or why
not?
5.96 Suppose that the random variables Y1 and Y2 have means μ1 and μ2 and variances σ 2
1 and
σ 2
2 , respectively. Use the basic definition of the covariance of two random variables to
establish that
a Cov(Y1, Y2) = Cov(Y2, Y1).
b Cov(Y1, Y1) = V (Y1) = σ 2
1 . That is, the covariance of a random variable and itself is just
the variance of the random variable.
5.97 The random variables Y1 and Y2 are such that E(Y1) = 4, E(Y2) = −1, V (Y1) = 2 and
V (Y2) = 8.
a What is Cov(Y1, Y1)?
b Assuming that the means and variances are correct, as given, is it possible that Cov(Y1,
Y2) = 7? [Hint: If Cov(Y1, Y2) = 7, what is the value of ρ, the coefficient of correlation?]
c Assuming that the means and variances are correct, what is the largest possible value for
Cov(Y1, Y2)? If Cov(Y1, Y2) achieves this largest value, what does that imply about the
relationship between Y1 and Y2 ?

d Assuming that the means and variances are correct, what is the smallest possible value for
Cov(Y1, Y2)? If Cov(Y1, Y2) achieves this smallest value, what does that imply about the
relationship between Y1 and Y2 ?
5.98 How big or small can Cov(Y1, Y2) be? Use the fact that ρ2 ≤ 1 to show that
−√V (Y1) × V (Y2) ≤ Cov(Y1, Y2) ≤ √V (Y1) × V (Y2).
5.99 If c is any constant and Y is a random variable such that E(Y ) exists, show that Cov(c, Y ) = 0.
