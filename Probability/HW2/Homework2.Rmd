2.1) Suppose a family contains two children of different ages, and we are interested in the gender of these children. Let $F$ denote that a child is female and $M$ that the child is male and let a pair such as $F,M$ denote that the older child is female and the younger is male. There are four points in the set S of possible observations:$$S = \{F F, F M, M F, M M\}.$$Let $A$ denote the subset of possibilities containing no males; $B$, the subset containing two males; and $C$, the subset containing at least one male. List the elements of $A, B, C, A  B, A  B, A  C, A  C, B  C, B  C,$ and $C  \overline{B}$.\
\
$$ A = \{FF\} \qquad B = \{MM\} \qquad C = \{FM, MF, MM\}$$ $$A \cap B = \emptyset \qquad A\cup B = \{MM,FF\} \qquad A \cap C = \emptyset$$ $$A \cup C = S = \{FF, FM, MF, MM\} \qquad B \cap C = \{MM\} $$ $$
B \cup C = C = \{FM, MF, MM\} \qquad C \cap \overline{B} = \{FM, MF\} $$\

2.2) Suppose that A and B are two events. Write expressions involving unions, intersections, and complements that describe the following:\
a Both events occur.\
b At least one occurs.\
c Neither occurs.\
d Exactly one occurs.\
\
$$a = A \cap B \qquad b = A \cup B \qquad C = \overline{A \cap B} \qquad d = (A \cap \overline{B} \cup B \cap \overline{A})$$

2.8) From a survey of 60 students attending a university, it was found that 9 were living off campus, 36 were undergraduates, and 3 were undergraduates living off campus. Find the number of these students who were\
a undergraduates, were living off campus, or both.\
b undergraduates living on campus.\
c graduate students living on campus.\

$$
a = 42 \qquad b = 33 \qquad c = 24 - 6 = 18
$$

\
2.9) Every persons blood type is A, B, AB, or O. In addition, each individual either has the Rhesus (Rh) factor (+) or does not (-). A medical technician records a persons blood type and Rh factor. List the sample space for this experiment\

$$
\text{Sample Space} = \{A-, B-, AB-, O-, A+, B+, AB+, O+\}
$$\
\
2.10)The proportions of blood phenotypes, A, B, AB, and O, in the population of all Caucasians in the United States are approximately .41, .10, .04, and .45, respectively. A single Caucasian is chosen at random from the population.\
a List the sample space for this experiment.\

$$
\text{Sample space } = \{A, B, AB, O\}
$$\
b Make use of the information given above to assign probabilities to each of the simple\
events\

$$P(A) = 0.41 \qquad P(B) = 0.10 \qquad P(AB) = 0.04 \qquad P(O) =0.45 $$\
. c What is the probability that the person chosen at random has either type A or type AB blood?\

$$
P(A) \cup P(AB) = 0.41 + 0.04 = 0.45
$$\

2.11) A sample space consists of five simple events, $E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4,$ and $E_5$.\
\
a If $P(E_1) = P(E_2) = 0.15, P(E_3) = 0.4$, and $P(E_4) = 2P(E_5)$, find the probabilities of $E_4$ and $E_5$.\
$$
(P(E_1) + P(E_2)) + P(E_3) = 0.30 + 0.40 = 0.70,$$\
$$\text{ so  } P(E_4) + P(E_5) = 0.30 $$

$$ \text{since } P(E_4) = 2P(E_5), \text{ that means } P(E_4) = 0.20 \text{ and } P(E_5) = 0.10.$$\

b If $P(E_1) = 3P(E_2) = 0.3$, find the probabilities of the remaining simple events if you know that the remaining simple events are equally probable.\

$$
P(E_1) = 0.1 \qquad P(E_2) = 0.3 \qquad P(E_3) = P(E_4) = P(E_5) = 0.2
$$

\
\
2.13) Americans can be quite suspicious, especially when it comes to government conspiracies. On the question of whether the U.S. Air Force has withheld proof of the existence of intelligent life on other planets, the proportions of Americans with varying opinions are given in the table.\
![](images/Screenshot%202025-09-09%20at%2023-36-00%20Mathematical%20Statistics%20with%20Applications%207th%20Edition%20-%20Mathematical%20Statistics%20with%20Applications-%207th%20Edition.pdf.png)\

\
c What is the probability that the person selected finds it at least somewhat likely that the Air Force is withholding information about intelligent life on other planets?

$$P(VT) \cup P(SL) = .24 + .24 = .48$$\

0.01 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.19
$$\
\
2.27) In Exercise 2.12 we considered a situation where cars entering an intersection each could turn right, turn left, or go straight. An experiment consists of observing two vehicles moving through the intersection.\

\
2.33) The Bureau of the Census reports that the median family income for all families in the United States during the year 2003 was \$43,318. That is, half of all American families had incomes exceeding this amount, and half had incomes equal to or below this amount. Suppose that four families are surveyed and that each one reveals whether its income exceeded \$43,318 in 2003.\
a List the points in the sample space.\

$$42 \text{ flights}$$\
\
2.37) A businesswoman in Philadelphia is preparing an itinerary for a visit to six major cities. The distance traveled, and hence the cost of the trip, will depend on the order in which she plans her route.\
a How many different itineraries (and trip costs) are possible?

$$6! = 720$$\
b If the businesswoman randomly selects one of the possible itineraries and Denver and San Francisco are two of the cities that she plans to visit, what is the probability that she will visit Denver before San Francisco?

$$\text{Half of them, so 0.5}$$\

\
2.49)Students attending the University of Florida can select from 130 major areas of study. A student’s major is identified in the registrar’s records with a two-or three-letter code (for example, statistics majors are identified by STA, math majors by MS). Some students opt for a double major and complete the requirements for both of the major areas before graduation. The registrar was asked to consider assigning these double majors a distinct two- or three-letter code so that they could be identified through the student records’ system. \
a What is the maximum number of possible double majors available to University of Florida students?

$${130 \choose 2} = 8385$$\
b If any two- or three-letter code is available to identify majors or double majors, how many major codes are available?

c How many major codes are required to identify students who have either a single major or a double major? \

$$8385 + 130 =  8515$$\
d Are there enough major codes available to identify all single and double majors at the University of Florida?\

$$\text{Yes there are}$$\
\
2.51) local fraternity is conducting a raffle where 50 tickets are to be sold—one per customer. There are three prizes to be awarded. If the four organizers of the raffle each buy one ticket, what is the probability that the four organizers win\
a all of the prizes? \
$$\text{Total is } {50 \choose 3} = 19600 \text{ so, }$$\
$$4/19600.$$\
b exactly two of the prizes?\

$${4 \choose 2}*{46 \choose 1} = 276, \text{ so, } 276 / 19600.$$\
c exactly one of the prizes?

$${46 \choose 2} * {4 \choose 1} = 4140, \text{ so, } 4140/19600.$$\
d none of the prizes?\

$${46 \choose 3} = 15,180, \text{ so, } 15180,19600.$$\
2.55) A study is to be conducted in a hospital to determine the attitudes of nurses toward various administrative procedures. A sample of 10 nurses is to be selected from a total of the 90 nurses employed by the hospital. \
a How many different samples of 10 nurses can be selected?

$${90 \choose 10}$$\
b Twenty of the 90 nurses are male. If 10 nurses are randomly selected from those employed by the hospital, what is the probability that the sample of ten will include exactly 4 male (and 6 female) nurses?\

$${20 \choose 4} * {70 \choose 6} / {90 \choose 10} = 0.111$$\
\
2.57)Two cards are drawn from a standard 52-card playing deck. What is the probability that the draw will yield an ace and a face card?\

$${52 \choose 2} = 1326$$\
$$4* 12 / 1326 = 0.0362$$\
\
\
2.59) Five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that we draw \

$${52 \choose 5} = 2598960$$\
$$4^5 /2598960 = 0.000394$$\
b any straight?\
\

$$
9 * 4^5 /2598960 = 0.00355
$$
