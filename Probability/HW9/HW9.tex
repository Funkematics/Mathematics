\begin{exercise}[4.58]
Use Table 4, Appendix 3, to find the following probabilities for a standard normal random variable $Z$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $P(0 \leq Z \leq 1.2)$
\begin{proof}[Solution]
 $.5000 - .1151 = .3849$
\end{proof}
    \item[(b)] $P(-.9 \leq Z \leq 0)$
\begin{proof}[Solution]
$.5000-.1841=.3159$ 
\end{proof}
    \item[(c)] $P(.3 \leq Z \leq 1.56)$
\begin{proof}[Solution]
$.3821-.0594 = .3227$ 
\end{proof}
    \item[(d)] $P(-.2 \leq Z \leq .2)$
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	$2*(.5000-.4207) = .1586$ 
\end{proof}
    \item[(e)] $P(-1.56 \leq Z \leq -.2)$
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	$(.5000-.0594) + (.5000-.4207) = .5199 $
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.59]
If $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, find the value $z_0$ such that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $P(Z > z_0) = .5$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
$z_0 = 0$ 
\end{proof}
    \item[(b)] $P(Z < z_0) = .8643$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
 $z_0 = 1.1$
\end{proof}
    \item[(c)] $P(-z_0 < Z < z_0) = .90$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	\begin{align*}
		.90 &=  P(Z<z_0) - 1 + P(Z< z_0) \\
		    &= 2P(Z<z_0) - 1 \\
		1.90 &= 2p(Z<z_0) \\
		0.95 &= p(Z<z_0) \\
		z_0 &= 1.645 
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
    \item[(d)] $P(-z_0 < Z < z_0) = .99$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.63]
A company that manufactures and bottles apple juice uses a machine that automatically fills 16-ounce bottles. There is some variation, however, in the amounts of liquid dispensed into the bottles that are filled. The amount dispensed has been observed to be approximately normally distributed with mean 16 ounces and standard deviation 1 ounce.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Use Table 4, Appendix 3, to determine the proportion of bottles that will have more than 17 ounces dispensed into them.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	\begin{align*}
		z &= \frac{\gamma - \mu}{\sigma} \\
		z &= \frac{17-16}{1} = 1 \\
		p(Z > 1) &= .1587
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.64]
The weekly amount of money spent on maintenance and repairs by a company was observed, over a long period of time, to be approximately normally distributed with mean \$400 and standard deviation \$20. If \$450 is budgeted for next week, what is the probability that the actual costs will exceed the budgeted amount?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Answer the question, using Table 4, Appendix 3.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	\begin{align*}
		z &= \frac{\gamma - \mu}{\sigma} \\
		z &= \frac{450 - 400}{20} = 2.5 \\
		P(Z > 2.5) &= .0062
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.65]
In Exercise 4.64, how much should be budgeted for weekly repairs and maintenance to provide that the probability the budgeted amount will be exceeded in a given week is only .1?

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Choose $z = 1.28$ from table $(P = .1003)$, let $n$ denote how much we should budget
	\begin{align*}
		z = 1.28 &= \frac{n - 400}{20} \\
		25.6 &= n - 400 \\
		425.6 &= n 
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.66]
A machining operation produces bearings with diameters that are normally distributed with mean 3.0005 inches and standard deviation .0010 inch. Specifications require the bearing diameters to lie in the interval $3.000 \pm .0020$ inches. Those outside the interval are considered scrap and must be remachined. With the existing machine setting, what fraction of total production will be scrap?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Answer the question, using Table 4, Appendix 3.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	\begin{align*}
		(z_0 + z_1) &= \frac{\gamma_0 - \mu}{\sigma} + \frac{\gamma_1 - \mu}{\sigma} \\
		&= \frac{3.0020 - 3.0005}{.0010} + \frac{2.9980 - 3.0005}{.0010} \\
		&\to P(Z>1.5) + P(Z < -2.5) \\
		&= .0668 + .0062 \\
		&= .0730

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Answer the question, using Table 4, Appendix 3.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	\begin{align*}
		z = \frac{\gamma - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3.0 - 2.4}{.8} = 0.75 \\
		P(Z > .75) = .2266

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[4.69]
Refer to Exercise 4.68. If students possessing a GPA less than 1.9 are dropped from college, what percentage of the students will be dropped?

\begin{proof}[Solution]

	 z = \frac{\gamma - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1.9 - 2.4}{.8} = -0.625 \\
	 P(Z < -0.625) = (.2676 + .2643)/2 = 0.26595
 \end{align*}
\end{proof}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
  \begin{align*}
    z_0 &= \frac{\gamma_0 - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{947 - 950}{10} = -0.3 \\
    z_1 &= \frac{\gamma_1 - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{958 - 950}{10} = 0.8  \\
        &  P(-0.3 \leq Z \leq 0.8) = 1 - (.3821 + .2119) = 0.406
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
    \item[(b)] What is the appropriate value for $C$ such that a randomly chosen bolt has a width less than $C$ with probability .8531?
\begin{proof}[Solution]
  \begin{align*}
    P(z_0 \leq Z) & = (1-.8531) = .1469 \\
                  & \to z_0 = 1.5 \\
                  & \to \frac{\gamma - 950}{10} = 1.05 \\
                  & \gamma = 10.5 + 950 = 960.5 = C

\begin{proof}[Solution]
  \begin{align*}
    z = \frac{\gamma - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{550 - 480}{100} = 0.7 \\
