\begin{problem} % Problem 36
Give a justified example of each, or argue (prove) that it is impossible.

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A sequence that has a subsequence that is bounded, but which contains no subsequence which converges.

This is impossible by Bolzano Weierstrass. Every bounded sequence has at least one convergent subsequence.

\item A sequence that does not contain $0$ or $1$ as a term, but which contains subsequences which converge to each of these values.

$$a_n = \frac{1 + (-1)^n}{2} + \frac{1}{n}$$ is such a sequence, we can set $n$ to even or odd numbers to converge to $0$ or $1$.

\item A sequence that contains subsequences converging to every point in the infinite set $\{1,1/2,1/3,1/4,\dots\}$.

  Consider that we can construct a subsequence that convergest to a chosen arbitrary value with $k - \frac{1}{n}$ where $k$ is any number we want to converge to and $\frac{1}{n}$ just going to zero. Let our sequence be defined by $a_n = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{n}$. For $k, n \in \NN$ this converges to every point in the infinite set.

\begin{problem} % Problem 37
Let $(a_n)$ be a bounded sequence.  Define the set
	$$S = \left\{x\in\RR\,:\, x < a_n \,\text{ for infinitely many terms } a_n\right\}.$$
Then $S$ is bounded above, and there exists a subsequence $(a_{n_k})$ which converges to $\sup S$.
\end{problem}
% Screw this problem in particular
\begin{proof}
Since $(a_n)$ is a bounded sequence, there exists an $M \in \RR$ such that $a_n \leq M$ for all $n \in \NN$. From this we have
$$x < a_n < M$$
by transitivity $x < M$ for all $x \in S$, so $S$ is bounded above by $M$. Since $S$ is a non-empty real set and bounded above, By Axiom of completeness, $s = \sup S$ exists.

Choose an arbitrary $k \in \NN$ so that we create an interval around the supremum $s$: $$s-\frac{1}{k} < s < s+\frac{1}{k}$$ Since any number smaller than $s$ is not an upper bound of $S$, there exists an $s' \in S$ so that $s-\frac{1}{k} < s'$($s'$ is in the interval below $s$). Since $s' \in S$, it follows by transitivity that $s-\frac{1}{k} < s' < a_n$, thus $s-\frac{1}{k} < a_n$ for infinitely many terms $a_n$. So we have $$s-\frac{1}{k} < a_n < s + \frac{1}{k}$$ Satisfied by every $k \in \NN$. We construct the subsequence $a_{n_k}$ recursively.
For $k = 1$, choose any $n_1 \in \NN$ such that $s - 1 < a_{n_1} \leq s + 1$. Having chosen 
$n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_k$, we choose $n_{k+1} > n_k$ such that 
$$s - \frac{1}{k+1} < a_{n_{k+1}} < s + \frac{1}{k+1}.$$ Now we show convergence, Let $\eps > 0$, choose $K \in \NN$ such that $\frac{1}{K} < \eps$. Then for all $k \geq K$, we have
$$\frac{1}{k} \leq \frac{1}{K} < \eps$$
By construction
$$s = \frac{1}{k} < a_{n_k} \leq s + \frac{1}{k}$$
Since $\frac{1}{k} < \eps$, we have
$$ s- \eps < s - \frac{1}{k} < a_{n_k} \leq s + \frac{1}{k} < s + \eps$$
thus $|a_{n_k} - s| < \eps$ meaning by definition there is a subsequence $a_{n_k}$ that converges to $\sup S$.

Give a justified example of each, or argue (prove) that it is impossible.

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Cauchy sequence that is not monotone.

Since all convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences, we just need to find any sequence that converges that is not monotone.
Let $a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$. 

\item A Cauchy sequence containing an unbounded subsequence.

Boundedness is a criteria for convergence so this is impossible

\item An unbounded sequence containing a Cauchy subsequence.

Impossible for the same reason as above

Ratio test:  For a series $\sum a_n$, if the sequence of terms $(a_n)$ satisfies $a_n\ne 0$ for all $n$, and if
	$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} = r < 1,$$
then the series converges absolutely.

% PLEASE READ:  Flesh out the following sketch of the proof.  For any $r'$ with $r < r' < 1$, explain why there exists $N$ so that if $n\ge N$ then $|a_{n+1}| \le r' |a_n|$.  Induct to get a bound on $|a_n|$, for $n\ge N$, in terms of a power of $r'$.  Explain why $|a_N| \sum_{n=N}^\infty (r')^{n-N}$ converges.
